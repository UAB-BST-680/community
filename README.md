# community
A forum for questions and discussions.

Comments and questions for the BST-680 course are held in the issues directory of this repository (i.e., the 'Issues' tab in the upper left of the navigation bar). 

Please post all content related questions here, and use email only for personal matters. Note that this is a public repository, and users from outside of the class may view or add comments to discussions.

To start a new thread, create a new issue. Tag your peers using their handle, e.g. @bcjaeger, to get their attention.

Once a question is answered, the issue will be closed, so lots of good answers might end up in closed issues. Don't forget to look there when looking for answers.

You can also use the "Search" feature on this repository to find things.

Guidelines for posting questions:

- First search existing issues (open or closed) for answers. If the question has already been answered, you're done! If there is an open issue, feel free to contribute to it. Or feel free to open a closed issue if you believe the answer is not satisfactory.

- Do not post questions asking for solutions to homework. It is okay to ask about specific errors you are dealing with while doing the homework, but not okay to ask broad questions about homework problems.

    + Good: "I am wondering how to position legends with ggplot2"
    
    + Bad: "Does anyone know how to do homework Problem 3?"

- Give your issue an informative title.

    + Good: "Error: could not find function "ggplot""
    
    + Bad: "R giving errors", "help me!", “aaaarrrrrgh!”
    
- Note that you can edit an issue’s title after it's been posted.

- Format your questions nicely using markdown and code formatting. Preview your issue prior to posting.

- Where appropriate, provide links to specific files, or even lines within them, in the body of your issue. This will help your helper understand your question. Note that only the teaching team will have access to private repos.

- (Optional) Tag someone or some group of people. Start by typing the @ symbol and GitHub will generate some good suggestions. You can also type or paste in the GitHub username yourself. Examples: to tag Mine, use `@bcjaeger`; to tag a class/team mate use their GitHub username.

- Hit "Submit new issue" when you're ready to post.
